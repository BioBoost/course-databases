# Excercises

All excercises for this course will need to be submitted in the form of one git repository on the [git.labict.be](https://git.labict.be) server.

Create a repository called `databases` and add a directory for every new exercise. Don't forget to commit and push changes to the git.labict.be server.

After a couple of exercises your project might look like this:

```text
databases
    README.md
    oef-0 
        result.sql
        report.md
    oef-1
        part1.sql
        part2.sql
        report.md
    oef-2
        report.md
```

## Reports

If an exercise demands a report, it must be written in `Markdown`. A description and examples of Markdown can be found over here: [Markdown](https://github.com/sillevl/course-databases/tree/206419169b16ae8f1090a6cddabb3b670a35fa4f/exercises/markdown.md).

All markdown files should have the `.md` file extension.
