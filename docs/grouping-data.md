# Grouping data

## Creating groups

SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods FROM products GROUP BY vend_id;
```
+---------+-----------+
| vend_id | num_prods |
+---------+-----------+
|    1001 |         3 |
|    1002 |         2 |
|    1003 |         7 |
|    1005 |         2 |
+---------+-----------+
```
## Filtering groups

SELECT cust_id, COUNT(*) AS orders FROM orders GROUP BY cust_id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```
+---------+--------+
| cust_id | orders |
+---------+--------+
|   10001 |      2 |
+---------+--------+
```

SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods FROM products WHERE prod_price >= 10 GROUP BY vend_id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```
+---------+-----------+
| vend_id | num_prods |
+---------+-----------+
|    1003 |         4 |
|    1005 |         2 |
+---------+-----------+
```
