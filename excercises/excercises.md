# Excercises

All excercises for this course will need to be submitted in the form of one git repository on the [git.labict.be](https://git.labict.be) server.

Create a repository called `databases` and add a directory for every new exercise. Don't forget to commit and push changes to the git.labict.be server.

After a couple of exercises your project might look like this:

```
databases
    README.md
    oef-0 
        result.sql
        report.md
    oef-1
        part1.sql
        part2.sql
        report.md
    oef-2
        report.md
```
